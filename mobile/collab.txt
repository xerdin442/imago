Welcome to Imago!

COLLABORATION WORKFLOW
-----------------------
- To begin working with the team, clone the repository to your local machine.
- DO NOT WRITE CODE ON THE MASTER BRANCH.
- Create a local feature branch for anything you're working on (e.g. feat/auth-screens), and make a pull request afterwards.
- Select 'xerdin442' as the reviewer before making the PR.
- The PR will be reviewed and merged to the master branch if all requirements are met.
- If there are corrections, it will be communicated to you. You can then update the feature branch and push the changes.
- If there are no corrections, create another feature branch locally and continue working.

ALL MOBILE-RELATED WORK WILL BE IN THE 'MOBILE' FOLDER

Happy to have you on the team!
